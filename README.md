# testJWTAuthentication

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
npm run test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
============ Append detail by mine ===========>>
This example will include a login page, a protected dashboard, and the necessary setup for handling JWTs.
Let's break this down into steps:

01. Project setup
02. Backend mock (since we're focusing on the frontend)
03. Authentication service
04. Vue components
05. Router setup
06. Main app structure

explain how this all works together:
01. The auth.service.js file contains methods for login, logout, and checking authentication status. It uses localStorage to store the JWT token and user information.
02. When a user logs in through the LoginForm component, it calls the login method from the auth service. If successful, it stores the token and user info, then redirects to the dashboard.
03. The Dashboard component displays user information and has a logout button. When logging out, it clears the stored data and redirects to the login page.
04. The router (index.js) sets up the routes and includes a navigation guard. This guard checks if a route requires authentication and redirects accordingly.
05. In a real application, you would include the JWT token in the Authorization header for API requests. You could create an axios instance or a custom fetch function like this:


When you run the project, you'll be redirected to the login page. Use the email "user@example.com" and password "password" to log in. You'll then be taken to the dashboard where you can see the user information and log out.

Remember, this is a simplified example. In a real-world application, you'd want to add error handling, loading states, and connect to a real backend API instead of using mock data.
